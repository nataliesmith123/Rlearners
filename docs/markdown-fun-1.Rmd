```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)


tmp_dataset <- tibble::tribble(~var1, ~var2, 
                               "hi", 1, 
                               "hello", 2, 
                               "bonjour", 3)


mean(tmp_dataset$var2)

```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

### This is a sub-section
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
