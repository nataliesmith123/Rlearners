This will be the R learners website for the summer! Most all of my resources will be posted here. 

Contact: Natalie Smith natsmith@live.unc.edu

## Intro

We will meet regularly on Mondays from 11am-1pm. I'll spend 1 hour (max) reviewing the topic for that day and the different packages, etc. that are involved. The second hour will be working through examples and is totally optional -- you can feel free to work through the examples on your own whenever works for you. 

This will be very casual -- kids, pets, eating are all okay! Interrupt me anytime via chat or audio to ask questions and *please* tell me to slow down if necessary. 

#### First month of topics: 

+ June 1: Workflows in R - projects, scripts, and markdown files. Integration with GitHub -- what is git & why you should use it, and using GitHub pages to make easy-to-access html webpages for your projects!
+ June 8: What are R objects, and why do I have to care? Types of variables in R - factors! Begin data management in R -- using the `tidyverse`
+ June 15: Natalie unavailable -- take week off, or someone else lead a session? Descriptive statistics in R? Can share my code for this and people work independently, or someone else moderate? 
+ June 22: Begin plotting!
+ June 29: Continue plotting! 




#### Potential topics

+ Data management with the `tidyverse` package(s). Would probably suggest two weeks of this.
    + Types of variables in R -- factors are the most unique to R specifically
    + Merging, subsetting, and transposing data
    + Creating new variables
+ Working with objects in R - what are they, how, and why??? `r emo::ji("angry")`
+ Descriptive statistics in R
    + There are many, many packages - how to choose? 
    + Overview with `skimr`
    + Missing data with `naniar` package
    + Full tables with `tableone`
    + There's also `stargazer` and some others
+ Basic modeling - lm, logistic, others?
+ Other stat topics? 
+ Plotting with R - endless `ggplot2` options here! Can review all sorts of x-y plots, there are some new options for making maps. 
+ R projects, R markdown, GitHub, & GitHub pages (how I am making this website, very nice for collabs)


#### Meeting times

Some fun data management to wrangle our data into shape for graphing
```{r dm, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

Now let's make a beautiful graph
```{r graph}
```





## Getting started

Two general options for how to access and use R

1. Use R through R studio on your actual computer
    + Download R v4.0.0 [here](http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
    + Download R studio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

2. Use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) without the commitment of installing on your computer. *disclaimer: I don't know as much / anything about this*
    + Don't have to download R software and the R studio wrapper
    + Possibly less functional for all the bells and whistles -- not sure about GitHub integration, etc. But probably just fine for learning the basics, and much less potential annoyance with installations, etc. 

3. *Optional* Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
    + Git is the open source program that allows committing etc. 

4. *Optional* Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
    + GitHub is where you push your commits to
    + Not necessary to use R. Is necessary to make a website (like this one) and use GitHub for collaborations, etc. 
    
5. *Optional* Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 
    + This is an interface that makes git not-scary and allows you to easily commit, push, and pull from your online GitHub account.
    + R Studio also has an interface to do this directly. Either one works. There can be some annoyances with getting the Git tab in R Studio to work in my experience, and I like the interface of GitHub Desktop better. 


## Sessions {.tabset}

### June 8 - Workflows

Quotes for the day from Jenny Bryan

> Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle when first adopting Git. 

> If the first line of your R script is `setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")` I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE `r emo::ji("fire")`.

 


#### Items to cover 

+ R & R Studio basics
    + Scripts
    + Different session options
    + Keyboard shortcuts
    + Global and project options -- see Resources for .Rdata suggestions (requirements? `r emo::ji("smile")`)
    + Two options for GitHub integration -- within R studio / with GitHub desktop. You might prefer one or the other. 
    + gitignore - **ALWAYS** ignore data folder if there is sensitive data!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        + I often ignore whole folders, like data, resources, output, etc.
        + GitHub desktop gives an easy interface to right-click and add things to the gitignore folder.
    + Relative file paths using `here` package
    + Markdown documents - the basics
        + Markdown language
        + `File` > `New file` > `R Markdown`
        + I keep mine relatively plain for the easiest integration with GitHub pages

+ See what my general workflow looks like
    + Show personal R project for Rlearners
    + Folder structure -- see below
    + File naming convention (when applicable - show Aim 2 scripts) Generally I do ##_informative-title.R
    + Show Git/GitHub desktop interface (with R learners). The three things you will do all the time: 
        + committing
        + pushing
        + pulling
    
+ Watch it in action
    1. Clone from repository
        + Delete Rlearners from computer - oh no!
        + Create a new project from version control repository
        + Make an edit
        + Commit changes
        + Push to repo
    2. Creating a repository online with .gitignore
    3. Creating a repository in R Studio and publishing online
    
    
#### Exercises

+ Exercise #1
    + Create an R project for our example repository we made in step 3 above
    + Create a script with a comment saying something
    + Commit & push to repository
  + Pull others' work
+ Exercise #2
    + Same thing, but with our R learners repository!
    + Check out the `index.Rmd` -- this is an R markdown document that we'll start talking about soon
    + Add your name and email (if you want to) to the 'People' tab -- all the way at the bottom
    + Good habit when collaborating: Pull before starting any of your own work
        + Open project & pull anytime to get the latest and greatest things I've committed.
+ Exercise #3
    + Make your own repository & R project for something

## Resources

This is my own compilation of useful R tidbits that don't have a good place to live, and my go-to resources for various things in R. 


+ Tools > Global Options > General > Make sure the following things are done. Best practice for reproducible work!
    + 'restore .Rdata' is unchecked
    + saving .Rdata is set to 'Never'
    + 'always save history' is unchecked. 
+ Emojis in R markdown
    + Install by: `devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")` (need `devtools` package installed)
