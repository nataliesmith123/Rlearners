This will be the R learners website for the summer! Most all of my resources will be posted here. 

Contact: Natalie Smith natsmith@live.unc.edu

## Intro

We will meet regularly on Mondays from 11am-1pm. I'll spend 1 hour (max) reviewing the topic for that day and the different packages, etc. that are involved. The second hour will be working through examples and is totally optional -- you can feel free to work through the examples on your own whenever works for you. 

This will be very casual -- kids, pets, eating are all okay! Interrupt me anytime via chat or audio to ask questions and *please* tell me to slow down if necessary. 

#### First month of topics: 

+ ~~June 1: Workflows in R - projects, scripts, and markdown files. Integration with GitHub -- what is git & why you should use it, and using GitHub pages to make easy-to-access html webpages for your projects!~~
+ ~~June 8: What are R objects, and why do I have to care?~~ 
+ ~~June 15: Kathleen lead data management introduction~~
+ ~~June 22: Review data management and begin plotting~~
+ ~~June 29: Continue plotting!~~
+ ~~July 6: More data management - joining/merging, transposing.~~
+ July 13: Descriptive statistics
+ July 20: Modeling - using outside resources
+ July 27: Final week! I'll be online for the usual 11-12ish hour and can review anything, help out with issues, etc. 




#### Potential topics

+ Data management with the `tidyverse` package(s)
    + Types of variables in R -- factors are the most unique to R specifically
    + Merging, subsetting, and transposing data
    + Creating new variables
+ Working with objects in R - what are they, how, and why??? `r emo::ji("angry")`
+ Descriptive statistics in R
    + There are many, many packages - how to choose? 
    + Overview with `skimr`
    + Missing data with `naniar` package
    + Full tables with `tableone`
    + There's also `stargazer` and some others
+ Basic modeling - lm, logistic, others?
+ Other stat topics? 
+ Plotting with R - endless `ggplot2` options here! Can review all sorts of x-y plots, there are some new options for making maps. 
+ R projects, R markdown, GitHub, & GitHub pages (how I am making this website, very nice for collabs)


#### Meeting times

Some fun data management to wrangle our data into shape for graphing
```{r dm, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

Now let's make a beautiful graph. 
```{r graph}
```

We're going to go with Mondays from 11am-1pm -- this is what the most people wanted! 



## Getting started

Two general options for how to access and use R

1. Use R through R studio on your actual computer
    + Download R v4.0.0 [here](http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
    + Download R studio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

2. Use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) without the commitment of installing on your computer. *disclaimer: I don't know as much / anything about this*
    + Don't have to download R software and the R studio wrapper
    + Possibly less functional for all the bells and whistles -- not sure about GitHub integration, etc. But probably just fine for learning the basics, and much less potential annoyance with installations, etc. 

3. *Optional* Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
    + Git is the open source program that allows committing etc. 

4. *Optional* Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
    + GitHub is where you push your commits to
    + Not necessary to use R. Is necessary to make a website (like this one) and use GitHub for collaborations, etc. 
    
5. *Optional* Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 
    + This is an interface that makes git not-scary and allows you to easily commit, push, and pull from your online GitHub account.
    + R Studio also has an interface to do this directly. Either one works. There can be some annoyances with getting the Git tab in R Studio to work in my experience, and I like the interface of GitHub Desktop better. 


## Sessions {.tabset}

### #1 - Workflows

Quotes for the day from Jenny Bryan

> Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle when first adopting Git. 

> If the first line of your R script is `setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")` I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE `r emo::ji("fire")`.


I'm going to walk through these items, and also show you examples of everything using the R learners folder/repository setup.  


#### Items to cover 

+ R & R Studio basics
    + R basics
        + Scripts
        + Different session options
        + Keyboard shortcuts
        + Install packages/libraries by `install.packages("LIBRARY_NAME")`
        + Load whole libraries like `library(LIBRARY_NAME)`
        + Use just one function from a library like `LIBRARY_NAME::FUNCTION` (helpful when you don't want the whole package, just one thing)
    + R projects
        + used to keep everything for one research project in order
            + generally, everyone on the team will have their own R project
            + add code from shared repository using Git/GitHub (more soon)
        + Global and project options -- see Resources for .Rdata suggestions (requirements? `r emo::ji("smile")`)
            + some options to help improve reproducibility and replicability within your and your team's workflows
        + Projects make relative file paths very easy. This allows for easy of switching computers, or multiple users working with the same code
            + Made even better with the `here` package! This function will look for an R project file, and then use that as the current directory and allows for easy manipulation of where to look for files. See `01_r-users-scheduling.R` for an example of its use, and there are some resources below.  

    
+ R markdown
    + Markdown language - simple to type, and then formats nicely
    + `File` > `New file` > `R Markdown`
    + I keep mine relatively plain for the easiest integration with GitHub pages
    + Can 'knit' to html (nicest looking), pdf, and word
    + Endless possibilities. I put some resources below -- I am constantly learning new things about markdown etc.!
    + Can pull in 'code chunks' from R scripts easily -- see this file for an example. 
        + make scripts. add `## @knitr CHUNK_NAME` before a code chunk
        + read the script-chunks into the R markdown file by adding something like `knitr::read_chunk(here::here("code", "01_r-users-scheduling.r"))`
        + then add a code chunk using the `Insert` button at the top right, and clicking `R`. 
        + add the chunks by modifying the first line of the chunk in the Markdown file to read ` ```{r CODE_CHUNK}`
        + I like to do this, but others also just write code directly in the Markdown file
    + R markdown files will knit in a new workspace every time, so really helpful to make sure you have consistent code flow, etc. 

    
+ Git and GitHub
    + Sort of like track changes for code
    + gitignore - **ALWAYS** ignore data folder if there is sensitive data!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    + I often ignore whole folders, like data, resources, output, etc.
    + GitHub desktop gives an easy interface to right-click and add things to the gitignore folder.
    + Watch it in action
        1. Creating a repository online with .gitignore
            + Create a new project from version control repository
            + Make an edit
            + Commit changes
            + Push to repo
        2. Creating a repository in R Studio and publishing online
    
    
+ See what my general workflow looks like
    + Show personal R project for Rlearners
    + Folder structure -- see below
    + File naming convention (when applicable - show Aim 2 scripts) Generally I do ##_informative-title.R
    + Show Git/GitHub desktop interface (with R learners). The three things you will do all the time: 
        + committing
        + pushing
        + pulling
    
    
#### Exercises

+ Change your global and project options to not save Rdata
+ Packages
    + Install the `tidyverse` and `here` packages
    + Load those packages
+ Start your own project
    + Make your R project for something (associate with repository if interested, either online or on your local file)
    + Create a script doing something simple
    + Create an R markdown document and link code (or just code in the markdown document)
    + (if using Git) Commit & push to repository
    + (if using Git) try adding me to the repository -- I can try to clone it and pull/push! My github username is `nataliesmith123`
+ Collaborating on the R learners repository
    + Same thing, but with our R learners repository!
    + Check out the `index.Rmd` -- this is an R markdown document that we'll start talking about soon
    + Good habit when collaborating: Pull before starting any of your own work
        + Open project & pull anytime to get the latest and greatest things I've committed.

```

### #2 - Objects

A variety of notes on objects

+ *My non-computer scientist opinion*: The term **object** is a catch-all for a 'thing' that is created. Objects are usually one kind of class and can include many different pieces ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) says "a combination of variables, functions, and data structures"). 
    + To me this means that datasets are objects -- their class is a dataset, and they contain variables. 
    + Here are the objects that I have come across the most in R:
        + matrices
        + vectors
        + dataframes/datasets and [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl_df-class.html) - a sub-type of dataframe. "tibbles are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more than base data.frames. This forces problems to be tackled earlier and more explicitly, typically leading to code that is more expressive and robust"
            + within these objects, each variable will have its own class. these can be: 
                + numeric (numbers with decimals, somtimes called a double, I think)
                + integer (numbers without decimals)
                + character (words)
                + factor (numbers with assigned labels)
                + lists (yes, you can have a list-column -- very meta. also very useful sometimes!)
        + lists
            + one of the objects with the biggest learning curve (I think)
            + lists hold multiple things -- those things can be dataframes, vectors, etc.
            + understanding lists and how R works with them is a whole new world -- but is rapidly changing, so I'm hesitant to do too much with it now.
            + in my experience, iterating through a list is R's alternative to for loops (though you can still write for loops!). However, I've seen on twitter that new things are coming down the pipeline. 
        + regression objects (which are also kind of lists)
        + ggplot objects (which are also kind of lists; I've not used them much)

    
#### Vectors
```{r vectors}
```

#### Matrices
```{r matrix}
```

#### Dataframes / Tibbles
```{r df}
```

#### Lists
```{r list}
```

#### Modeling Objects
```{r lm}
```

#### Visualization Objects
```{r gg}
```









### #3 - Data management

The main data management things we will cover by working through a (contrived) exercise together

+ getting a sense of your data using `skimr`
+ renaming variables: use `rename()` function in `tidyverse`
    + `rename()` keeps all variables 
    + `rename(newVarName = oldVarName)`
+ creating new variables: `mutate()`
    + `mutate(newvar = someCommand)`
    + use `if_else()` for if/else statements
    + use `case_when()` as a substitute for nested if/else statements
    + certain R functions that are not 'vectorized' cannot work over multiple columns (e.g., can't take mean of col1 and col2 directly in `tidyverse`). You either need to write out (col1+col2)/2 by hand, or call `rowwise()` to explicitly tell R to perform everything on a row-by-row basis.
+ subsetting data: `filter()`
    + this defines what ROWS you want to keep
+ keeping and deleting variables/COLUMNS: `select()`
    + to drop variables, add them to the select function like so: `select(-age)`
    + to keep variables, do the same except take out the `-`
    + can keep all variables within a range by using a colon `select(var1:var10)`
    + can also use things like `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` which are very cool
    + can also rename 'on-the-fly' within a select statement using the same syntax as `rename()` above
+ sorting data: `arrange()`
    + this will RESET row names, so make sure you always have a unique ID variable and are not relying on implicit dataset ordering
+ importing and exporting data to a variety of file types/softwares (see section below for some examples)
    + `readxl` and `foreign` libraries have support for this
    + reading and writing csv files is done with `read_csv()` and `write_csv()` in base R
    + `File` > `Import Dataset` is actually very helpful for this
+ options for transposing data: `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` (have not added examples of this, yet)


A few programming notes: 

+ R uses `&` (and); `|` (or)
+ `is.na()` checks if that variable is NA (missing)
+ can use `!` in front of `is.na()` to check if that variable is not missing
+ The usual <, <=, >, >=
+ use `%in%` function to avoid long strings of or statements
+ use [pipes](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) when reasonable


#### Exercises / work though together

Use the diamonds dataset (will be loaded after you load tidyverse package)

+ Skim the data
+ Create a variable called `diamondID` using the `rownames_to_column()` function
+ Sort data by `diamondID`
+ Subset data to just those diamonds that are less than or equal to one carat, and cost less than $1,000
+ Create two new variables that are **unordered** factor variables for diamond cut and color
    + While yes, these are technially ordered variables, if you try to use an ordered variable in a regression it will treat it as continuous, rather than create multiple indicators. Treating as continuous may be what you want, may not be. Just something to be aware of. 
+ Create a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if the diamonds color was rated D, E, or F, 0 otherwise
+ Create a factor variable based on the previous dichotomous variable and give it nice value labels
+ Use `table()` or `xtabs()` to check your derived variables 
+ Recreate depth variable (see `?diamonds` for the formula)
    + ah!! `mean()` doesn't work `r emo::ji("sad")`
    + this is because it's not [vectorized](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-rowwise/)
    + try it two ways - manually creating mean, and using `rowwise()`

```{r importExport}

### #4 - Visualization 1.0

Quick review of 1) any data management questions, and 2) import/export code from last session. 

Plotting things to cover: 

+ Base vs. ggplot
    + base does not require any additional packages to be used
        + `plot()` is for scatterplot
        + `hist()` for histogram
        + any conditional or group coloring, superimposing lines and dots, etc. gets very difficult within base (I think)
    + [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is the workhorse that most all of us will want to use 
        + graph multiple relationships on one plot
        + almost endlessly customizable 
        + colors, etc. 
+ ggplot basics
    + "It’s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and coordinate systems (like coord_flip())." from [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
    + format for data -- grouping variable should be in columns
    + aesthetics -- what will be displayed
        + x and y (usually will always be used)
        + fill = inside color, color = outside color
        + alpha = transparency
        + size = size of point, line thickness, etc.
        + shape of points, stroke (outside line), and i'm sure many others
    + geoms -- how those aesthetics are displayed
        + geom_point() for scatterplot
        + geom_line() for lines
        + geom_density() for density plots
        + geom_bar() for bar charts
        + geom_histogram() for histograms
        + many, many others
        
Example plots to make: 

1. Plot of carat by price, colored by cutIdeal 
2. Plot #1, but manually change the colors to be blue and red
3. Distribution of diamond prices using geom_density, with a thick blue line of the density and the distribution filled underneath with light blue
4. Distribution of carats using geom_histogram. outline the bins in black and the fill with light gray. use 50 bins.  
5. Overlay a density plot on the histogram. what happens when you do the density geom FIRST, and then the histogram? the density should be dark blue and line size = 50
6. Graph the mean of price by carats and color it by ideal cut. Split carats into 10 percentiles and use the ideal/not ideal variable. (this is hard!) 

```{r viz1}
```


### #5 - Visualization 2.0

**our work from today is in the same codeblock as Visualization 1.0**

+ Review from last week
    + update on group_by !! 
+ [Faceting](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html) - repeating graph for level(s) of variable(s)
+ Modifying components of a theme
    + title, subtitle, caption, axis labels
    + overall ggplot [themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)
    + see Andrew Heiss tutorial below for help with themes too
    + Use exercise #6 from last week to practice modifying components of a theme
        + where legend is (and removing legend)
        + remove legend title
        + axis ticks
        + axis lengths
+ Save ggplots using `ggsave()` function
+ Fun geoms
    + violin plots
    + dotplots (underutilized, I think!)
+ can use `ggsave()` to save png, pdf, etc.     
    

Additional plotting resources: 

+ Colors: 
    + `ggsci`: color palettes matching major journals [here](https://nanx.me/ggsci/articles/ggsci.html)
    + `Rcolorbrewer`: major package with many palettes [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html). Note sequential, diverging, and qualitative palette types!
    + R color names [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf). Can also type `colors()` to see all names. 
    + Can also use hexadecimal color codes in R - make sure to put in quotes
+ *Very good* `ggplot` intro by [Andrew Heiss](https://twitter.com/andrewheiss) [here](https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/). Also some `tidyverse` but not enough to fully understand it


### #6 - More data management

+ joining
    + documentation classifies joins in three ways - mutating, filtering, and nesting. mutating is the most common, especially for our type of work (generally)
    + mutating
        + `left_join()`: prioritizes the *left hand side* data frame ('prioritizes' means it returns those rows)
        + `full_join()`: keeps all rows from both data frames 
        + there's also `right_join()` and `inner_join()` that have similar behavior
    + filtering
        + used to keep cases from the 'left hand' dataframe. `semi_join()` and `anti_join()`
    + nesting
        + 'creates a list column of data.frames()'. i've never used this!
+ transposing - `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`
+ begin descriptives if time -- `tableone()` package


Exercises: 

+ import excel data (use here function)
+ join patronus data to characters data
    1. first join the id data to characters, by Name (join variable called Name in both datasets)
    2. use abbrev variable to add patronus data (join variable named differently in each dataset)
+ keep only those characters who are in one of the four Hogwarts houses
+ create a new variable that =1 if a character is female, =0 if male
+ group by hogwarts house
    + count the number of people in each Hogwarts house
    + calculate the proportion of women in each hogwarts house
+ tranposing - take character data and make it 'longer', then go back 'wider'
+ package mentions - tidylog and tidyselect


```{r hpdm}
```

    



### #7 Descriptives & Table-making

+ Descriptive statistics in R
    + There are many, many packages - how to choose? 
    + Getting basic descriptive statistics
        + `skimr` - I think this is the most basic of descriptive packages, and I like how I can get an overview of both missing data and summary stats. Not sure about its use for stratified descriptives and/or exporting to other software. 
        + `desctable` - this is a newer package. I am still figuring it all out, but it seems like it can finally do everything I want in a descriptive stats package. Vignette about its use [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/desctable/vignettes/desctable.html)
        + `tableone` - I find this a very annoying package but it usually gets the job done
    + Missing data with `naniar` package
+ Exporting to excel and linking spreadsheets - export raw descriptives from R, link to a formatted excel sheet, update as needed. 

```{r descriptives}
```



### #8 - Modeling

+ [Fantastic resource](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/index.html) from UVa -- I am going to use this to talk about modeling. I don't feel like I could do it justice on my own (I haven't done much with modeling in R) and so will err on the side of finding good resources.
+ [Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html) textbook. Amazing!
