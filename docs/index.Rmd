This will be the R learners website for the summer! Most all of my resources will be posted here. 

## First meeting

1. Topics to cover
2. When & how often to meet
3. Downloaded and working with R successfully

## Getting started

You have two options for how to access and use R

1. Use R through R studio on your actual computer
    + Download R v4.0.0 [here](http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
    + Download R studio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

2. Use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) without the commitment of installing on your computer. *disclaimer: I don't know as much / anything about this*
    + Don't have to download R software and the R studio wrapper
    + Possibly less functional for all the bells and whistles -- not sure about GitHub integration, etc. But probably just fine for learning the basics, and much less potential annoyance with installations, etc. 


## Resources

This is my own compilation of useful R tidbits that don't have a good place to live, and my go-to resources for various things in R.
